# WinForms

The project is built on the WinForms platform, allowing for various operations on numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is also capable of calculating percentages. Additionally, the calculator takes into account the possibility of entering negative numbers.

To enhance the program's appearance and make it more appealing, the project utilizes the `Application` class. The `SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault` method helps configure text rendering to ensure proper display on the screen. The `EnableVisualStyles` method enables the use of visual styles, making the interface more modern and attractive.
